						<h1>Hannie Pham<br />
						</h1>
						<p> Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
						<p> Hi, there! My name is Hannie Pham. As a motivated undergraduate student majoring in Data Analytics and Quantitative Economics, I have a passion for exploring the world of data and using it to make informed decisions. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in statistics, econometrics, and data analysis techniques while using SQL, Python, R, and Excel to process datasets along with PowerBI, and Tableau to convey remarkable data stories. My goal is to bridge the gap between data and decision-making by applying the quantitative skills I've acquired in real-world scenarios.<br />

									<h1>A Little About Me<br />
									</h1>
									<p> Xin chào! Hello! Halo!​ I am Hannie Pham, a sophomore double-majoring in Data Analytics and Quantitative Economics at Dickinson College.<br />
									The girl with a soaring and carefree soul is me. <br />
									</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/mypic.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>While many young people at my age, especially boys, often talk about Captain America and Marvel heroes, I found my true hero in the Disney princess Mulan, the girl who firmly followed the path of becoming a soldier even though her family opposed it. In my world, not only princesses are the ones who are weak and possess beauty, but they also have all excellent qualities, and never give up no matter what social norms are imposed on them. Every princess has to carry the weight of the crown, which represents the responsibility of finding her talents and using her passion to create a larger impact on society.</p>
								<p>For me, the social norm I have to overcome is my mom’s expectation since I was born to become a doctor, which is the only career pathway that can satisfy my family. However, my fear was much greater since I am afraid of scratches on the skin and bloodstains on the patient's body. These reasons prevent me from becoming a doctor. Instead of standing tensely for several hours in the operating room under the pressure of the patients' heartbeat, I feel more excited while using technologies to connect my community together. I love spending time writing a big chunk of essays on social media such as sharing my tips to prepare necessary packages for travels or to prepare for exam days with friends, unfortunately, my mom thought this activity was a waste of time.</p>
								<p>The challenge I had to overcome was not so obvious as a financial hurdle, but rather a subtle lack of emotional support to pursue an entirely different field. As my critical thinking developed growing up, I realized how important choosing a suitable career is because I can be confident and follow my passion with the strengths I have. Regardless of what people expect me to do, I have decided to be brave and determined like the princesses I watched.</p>
								<p>After the Covid epidemic, I realized the importance of Data-Based Decision Making. The pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for data-driven decision making at both the macro and micro levels. Governments rely on data analytics to track the spread of the virus, allocate resources, and carry out targeted interventions. Businesses have used quantitative methods to adjust operations, forecast demand, and navigate supply chain disruptions. The pandemic has reinforced the value of using data and quantitative insights to make decisions in uncertain and rapidly changing environments. This starting point of view has motivated me to pursue a career in Data Analytics and Quantitative Economics, where I can understand and monitor the workings of this world. I want to become a true princess and tell myself that I must be strong and always hold my head high in all situations.</p>
